                    Mitsuha Miyamizu, a high school girl, yearns to live the life of a boy in the bustling city of
                    Tokyo—a dream that stands in stark contrast to her present life in the countryside. Meanwhile in the
                    city, Taki Tachibana lives a busy life as a high school student while juggling his part-time job and
                    hopes for a future in architecture. One day, Mitsuha awakens in a room that is not her own and
                    suddenly finds herself living the dream life in Tokyo—but in Taki's body! Elsewhere, Taki finds
                    himself living Mitsuha's life in the humble countryside. In pursuit of an answer to this strange
                    phenomenon, they begin to search for one another. Kimi no Na wa. revolves around Mitsuha and Taki's
                    actions, which begin to have a dramatic impact on each other's lives, weaving them into a fabric
                    held together by fate and circumstance.

                    As a wild youth, elementary school student Shouya Ishida sought to beat boredom in the cruelest ways. When the deaf Shouko Nishimiya transfers into his class, Shouya and the rest of his class thoughtlessly bully her for fun. However, when her mother notifies the school, he is singled out and blamed for everything done to her. With Shouko transferring out of the school, Shouya is left at the mercy of his classmates. He is heartlessly ostracized all throughout elementary and middle school, while teachers turn a blind eye. Now in his third year of high school, Shouya is still plagued by his wrongdoings as a young boy. Sincerely regretting his past actions, he sets out on a journey of redemption: to meet Shouko once more and make amends. Koe no Katachi tells the heartwarming tale of Shouya's reunion with Shouko and his honest attempts to redeem himself, all while being continually haunted by the shadows of his past.

It is at this moment that she gains just one more person to share her secret. Trying to maintain a normal life as much as possible, Sakura is determined to live her life to the fullest until the very last day. As her free spirit and unpredictable actions throw him for a loop, his heart begins to gradually change.

                    Life for 17-year-old Konno Makoto is filled with fun days at school and hanging out with her two best friends, Chiaki and Kousuke. But then she finds herself with an ominous ability to leap back in time. A truly strange ability that at first saves her life, but then allows her to not be late at school, to know the answers on any surprise exams and to avoid any troublesome mishaps. It is only when Makoto chooses to use this ability to avoid some of the more personal issues that arise with her friends, that events become both complex and painfully difficult — the simple gift that she began to take for granted suddenly becomes a troublesome burden.
